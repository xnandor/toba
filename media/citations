Hi Everyone how are you all? Just popped by to wish you a very Happy Healthy New Year, and to thank you for all your support of my last upload, and those for 2015 it is so appreciated.
Here you see the Saint Bernard who by chance is one of the hand painted dogs in my JaneEden'sDogs2 available from my store www.yurdigital.com/catalog/468…    
The Saint Bernard is amongst the most massive of all dogs; and seems to have grown heavier over the years from the days when he was known to the world as the mountain-rescue dog of Switzerland, famed by the cartoonist's pencil for his brandy barrel. That is what inspired me to have a go at painting a brandy barrel for him here. Many a person has been saved by this wonderful benevolent dog with a very big heart.
Take care all, and hope this year is a great one for you, hugs Jane xx
p.s. all the above is hand painted using Wacom Intuos3 tablet and pen, in PSCS4 x

The next Chromatic Robo! Green this time :)
This guy is meant to be a worker/heavy lifter type robo, but to break away from the WALL-E vibe I was getting I made him green and decided to make him look like he has been out working in the jungle for a while without proper maintenance, thus all the dings, scratches and *gasp* rust on him.
I had a lot of fun on this one, for some reason I seem like painting things that are muddy and banged up... so this one was a bit of a no-brainer I guess.
Next up... blue!

Prophet Character
Plague Doctor

My friend told me that I should invest more into my secret love affair with steampunk themes. Some of my recent work prodded at science's folleys, so I wanted to balance it out with one of medicine's ballsiest group of doctors.
I envisioned a world where the plague didn't simply incapacitate and slowly kill people; it drove them out of their minds, with widespread riots being waged by the fearful masses. 
I wanted the unsettling likeness of a plague doctor for that, but something a bit more militant and priestly, in addition to holding to the grungy, clunky technology of the genre with "cure by any means necessary" undertones.
A lot of time was spent on this, and some experimentation was done as well. Normally I don't work with overlaid textures, and I think it gets a bit gridded-out in some places. I want to refine that, because rendering individual threads and woodgrain lines like I did in "Totems" is just overkill.
It's also more realistic than I'd like to work, all things considered. The character's proportions were meant to be distorted, but avoiding that for so many years made the process really uncomfortable.
Also this is a work of visual fiction and is in no way meant to be historically accurate. I'm happy to answer any questions regarding the character and what all is going on with his suit though.
Furthermore, I hate trying to make smoke.
